## 🔹 About Me
Hi, I'm Amar, a current CS + Stat student at UMD. I'm passionate about software engineering, machine learning research, infrastructure and DevOps, and embedded systems and PCB design, as well as anything else interesting in tech.  

In the past, I've done projects to expand my skills and make some really cool things, as well as roles at startups and research where we work from the ground on software products and experimentation. I’m looking to get experience on **bigger, high-velocity projects** and continue to make strides in my knowledge!  

I've also been looking to learn more about fields like embedded and electrical engineering that I haven't done a big solo project on, as well as explore topics like quant-specific data science and low-level software. Besides that, I'm always building or researching something cool — feel free to reach out!
