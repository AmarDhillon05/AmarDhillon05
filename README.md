## ðŸ”¹ About Me
Hi, I'm Amar, a current CS + Stat student at UMD. I'm passionate about software engineering , machine learning research, infrastructure and devops, and embedded systems and PCB design, as well as anything else interesting in tech. In the past, I've done projects to expand my skills and make some really cool things, as well as roles at startupts and research where we work from the ground on software products and experimentation, however I'm looking to get some experience on bigger, high-velocity projects and continue to make strides in my knowledge and experience! I've also been looking to learn more about fields like embedded and electrical engineering that I haven't truly done a big solo project on, as well as explore new topics like quant-specific data science and low-level software. Besides that, I'm always building or researching something cool, so feel free to reach out!

## ðŸ”¹ Projects
- PianoAI  (Light purple/white) https://github.com/AmarDhillon05/PianoAi-v2- A music composition app with features that use a trained model to generate music notes. I've been making some improvements like refining the model with more intuitive training on a model small enough to host on a Lmabda function, and making the UI easier to build on.
- Echelon (Purple/Gold) https://github.com/AmarDhillon05/echelon An app that adds features like fast ELO matchmaking and project scrolling to competitive events like hackathos, complete with the ability to import from platforms like Devpost. We're currently drafting more features to give the app a better identity, but will deploy a beta soon and test at some hackathons!
- $hoes (Red/Black) https://github.com/AmarDhillon05/Shoes An app that scrapes and runs a regression model on shoe prices, trained on a variety of past public stockX sales, and gives daily updates. This is currently down, but I've been thinking of improvements on compressing the model and making the site multi-functional

...and more! Feel free to reach out if you ever want to build something cool!
